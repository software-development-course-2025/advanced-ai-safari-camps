# Welcome to the Advanced AI Safari Camps Program

This program is a **showcase** of my skills and knowledge in **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, and **Neural Networks**. It has been carefully structured to demonstrate my command of theoretical concepts and my ability to apply them in practical, real-world projects.

Inside, you will find the **complete solutions** to the assignments and projects from the **Advanced AI Safari Camps** module, from initial analysis to final implementation. I invite evaluators, examiners, and recruiters to explore the code, dive into the notebooks, and see the quality of my work firsthand.

Each **commit** is a fundamental piece of this learning journey. You can track my progress and understand the logic behind every step:

* **Brief Commits:** Concise summaries of changes, like `feat: Add link to interactive version in README` or `chore: rename PDF for release consistency`.
* **Detailed Commits:** In-depth descriptions of what was done and why, including design decisions and technical justifications.
